# Research: Multi-Agent Configuration Safeguards and Error Handling

## Configuration Isolation Patterns

**Decision**: Implement per-agent configuration directories with global registry
**Rationale**: Prevents file conflicts while maintaining centralized management. Allows independent agent lifecycle management without affecting other agents.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Single shared configuration (rejected - causes overwrites)
- Completely separate projects (rejected - adds complexity)
- Database storage (rejected - adds dependencies)

## Error Handling and Recovery Strategies

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive error context tracking with resource inventories
**Rationale**: Enables proper cleanup and user guidance during partial failures. Tracks both AWS resources and local files for complete recovery.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Basic try/catch only (rejected - insufficient for complex workflows)
- External error tracking service (rejected - adds dependencies)
- Log-only error handling (rejected - poor user experience)

## User Confirmation and Safety Mechanisms

**Decision**: Interactive prompts with clear impact descriptions for destructive operations
**Rationale**: Prevents accidental data loss while maintaining workflow efficiency. Provides users with clear understanding of consequences.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Always overwrite silently (rejected - causes data loss)
- Always reject conflicts (rejected - blocks legitimate use cases)
- Backup and restore (rejected - adds complexity)

## Build Artifact Isolation

**Decision**: Automatic per-agent build directories during launch operations
**Rationale**: Protects source code from modifications and enables proper multi-agent support without separate packaging commands.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Shared build directory (rejected - causes agent conflicts)
- Manual packaging step (rejected - violates no-new-commands requirement)
- In-place builds (rejected - risks source contamination)

## Progress Indication and User Experience

**Decision**: Rich console output with progress bars for operations >5 seconds
**Rationale**: Improves user experience for long-running operations while maintaining CLI efficiency for quick tasks.
**Alternatives considered**:
- No progress indication (rejected - poor UX)
- Progress for all operations (rejected - unnecessary noise)
- Web-based progress UI (rejected - breaks CLI paradigm)

## YAML Configuration Schema Evolution

**Decision**: Extend existing schema with backward compatibility and automatic migration
**Rationale**: Maintains compatibility with existing deployments while adding new multi-agent capabilities.
**Alternatives considered**:
- New configuration format (rejected - breaks existing users)
- Side-by-side configurations (rejected - confuses users)
- Database migration approach (rejected - overkill for file format)

## Testing Strategy for Multi-Agent Scenarios

**Decision**: Enhanced test coverage with multi-agent fixtures and AWS resource mocking
**Rationale**: Ensures reliability of complex multi-agent workflows while maintaining fast test execution.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Integration tests only (rejected - slow feedback)
- Unit tests only (rejected - misses interaction bugs)
- Manual testing only (rejected - unsustainable)
