# Feature Specification: Enhanced Configuration Management with Backward Compatibility

**Feature Branch**: `002-only-enhance-and`
**Created**: 2025-01-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "only enhance and maintain backward compatibility, don't introduce # NEW ERROR RECOVERY (proposed) last_operation: # FR-017-020: error tracking operation_id: \"launch-20250106-123456\" aws_resources_created: [...] local_files_created: [...], also whats the simplest experience for: # NEW ENHANCEMENTS (proposed additions) source_path: \"/path/to/source\" # FR-007: source tracking build_artifacts: # FR-011-014: build isolation build_directory: \".packages/my-agent\" source_copy_path: \".packages/my-agent/src\" dockerfile_path: \".packages/my-agent/Dockerfile\""

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a developer using AgentCore Starter Toolkit**, I want enhanced configuration management capabilities that improve my experience with source tracking and build artifact organization, while ensuring my existing configurations continue to work without any changes or migrations required.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have an existing `.bedrock_agentcore.yaml` file with configured agents, **When** I upgrade to the enhanced version, **Then** all my existing configurations work exactly as before without any manual changes.

2. **Given** I am configuring a new agent, **When** I specify a source path during configuration, **Then** the system tracks the source location and uses it consistently for all operations without me needing to remember or re-specify it.

3. **Given** I have multiple agents configured, **When** I launch any agent, **Then** the system automatically creates organized build artifacts in predictable locations that don't interfere with my source code or other agents' artifacts.

4. **Given** I want to understand my current configuration setup, **When** I request information about my agents, **Then** the system shows me clear information about source paths and build artifact locations in an easily understandable format.

5. **Given** I am working with build artifacts, **When** the system creates them, **Then** they are organized in a simple, predictable structure that makes it easy for me to find and understand what belongs to which agent.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user has source code in a directory that gets moved or renamed after configuration?
- How does the system handle build artifacts when disk space is limited?
- What occurs when multiple users share the same project directory with different agents configured?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Backward Compatibility (Critical)
- **FR-001**: System MUST continue to work with all existing `.bedrock_agentcore.yaml` files without requiring any user changes or migrations
- **FR-002**: System MUST preserve all current configuration behaviors and command interfaces exactly as they exist today
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain the existing multi-agent configuration structure and functionality that already exists

#### Source Path Enhancement
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to specify and track the source code location for each agent during configuration
- **FR-005**: System MUST use the tracked source path consistently for all operations related to that agent
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide simple, clear feedback about where source code is being loaded from for each agent
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate that tracked source paths exist and are accessible before performing operations

#### Build Artifact Organization
- **FR-008**: System MUST automatically create organized build artifacts in predictable, easy-to-understand locations
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure build artifacts for different agents are clearly separated and identifiable
- **FR-010**: System MUST use simple, consistent naming patterns for build artifact directories and files
- **FR-011**: System MUST make it easy for users to locate and understand build artifacts for troubleshooting purposes

#### User Experience Simplification
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide the simplest possible experience for users to track source paths and find build artifacts
- **FR-013**: System MUST use clear, intuitive defaults for all new functionality to minimize configuration complexity
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide helpful information about source paths and build artifacts when users request agent status or information

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Enhanced Agent Configuration**: Existing agent configuration extended with optional source path tracking and build artifact location information
- **Build Artifact Organization**: Structured file organization for build outputs that maintains clear separation between agents and provides predictable locations
- **Source Path Tracking**: Simple mechanism to remember and consistently use the source code location for each configured agent
