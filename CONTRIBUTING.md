## Development Setup (For AWS Team Members)

### About Package Management

This project uses [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management, providing:

- ‚ö° 10-100x faster package installation than pip
- üîí Lockfile support for reproducible builds
- üì¶ Built-in virtual environment management
- üéØ PEP 517 compliant builds

The repository includes:

- `pyproject.toml` - Project metadata and dependencies
- `uv.lock` - Locked dependency versions for reproducibility

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone and create virtual environment with dependencies
git clone https://github.com/aws/bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit.git
cd bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit

uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv sync

# Install pre-commit hooks (one-time)
pre-commit install
```

That's it! You're ready to develop.

### Daily Development Workflow

Pre-commit hooks will now run automatically:

```bash
# Make your changes
vim src/bedrock_agentcore_starter_toolkit/cli/commands.py

# Commit (hooks run automatically)
git commit -m "feat: add new command"
# ‚Üë Formatting and linting run here (~10-20 seconds)

# Push (tests run automatically)
git push origin my-branch
# ‚Üë Security scanning and tests run here (~2-5 minutes)
```

### What the Hooks Check

**On every commit** (~10-20 seconds):
- ‚úÖ Code formatting (auto-fixes with ruff)
- ‚úÖ Import sorting (auto-fixes)
- ‚úÖ Linting (with ruff)
- ‚úÖ File hygiene (trailing whitespace, etc.)

**Before every push** (~2-5 minutes):
- ‚úÖ Security scanning (bandit)
- ‚úÖ Full test suite with coverage

### Skipping Hooks (WIP Commits)

For work-in-progress commits, you can skip checks:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "wip: incomplete work"
```

**Please run all checks before opening a PR!**

### Running Checks Manually

```bash
# Run all pre-commit checks
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run only pre-commit stage (fast)
pre-commit run --hook-stage pre-commit --all-files

# Run only pre-push stage (includes tests)
pre-commit run --hook-stage pre-push --all-files

# Run tests manually
uv run pytest tests/ --cov=src

# Run the CLI
uv run agentcore --help

# Add new dependencies
uv add requests

# Add development dependencies
uv add --dev pytest-mock
```
