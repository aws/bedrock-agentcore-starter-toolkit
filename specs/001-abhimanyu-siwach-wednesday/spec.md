# Feature Specification: Multi-Agent Configuration Safeguards and Error Handling

**Feature Branch**: `001-abhimanyu-siwach-wednesday`
**Created**: 2025-01-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "DevRel feedback on startertoolkit must fix issues: Implement safeguards against unintended configuration overwrites, Support multiple agent configurations without file conflicts, Add graceful failure handling for all commands (e.g. try, catch)"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a developer using AgentCore Starter Toolkit**, I want to configure and deploy multiple AI agents without configuration conflicts, so that each agent deploys correctly from its intended source code and configuration, and I can recover gracefully from any errors during the process.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have two different agent projects (first_agent and second_agent), **When** I configure both agents using `agentcore configure`, **Then** each agent maintains its own isolated configuration and deployment artifacts without overwriting the other's files.

2. **Given** I am configuring multiple agents, **When** I specify different output directories for each agent configuration, **Then** each agent's configuration files are stored in the specified location without conflicts.

3. **Given** I have configured multiple agents with different source paths, **When** I launch each agent individually, **Then** each agent deploys from its correct source code and not from the last configured agent's source.

4. **Given** an error occurs during any AgentCore command execution, **When** the error happens mid-process, **Then** the system handles the error gracefully, provides clear error messages, reports what resources were created or modified, and allows for proper cleanup.

5. **Given** I launch an agent for deployment, **When** the launch process runs, **Then** the system automatically creates isolated build artifacts that protect against accidental source code changes.

### Edge Cases
- When a user configures an agent with an existing name, the system prompts for confirmation before overwriting the existing configuration
- How does the system handle partial failures during multi-step operations (configure → launch)?
- What happens when configuration directories don't have proper write permissions?
- How does the system behave when users attempt to launch an agent with missing or corrupted source files?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Configuration Isolation
- **FR-001**: System MUST prevent configuration overwrites when configuring multiple agents with different names
- **FR-002**: System MUST store each agent's configuration in isolated directories to prevent file conflicts
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to specify custom output directories for agent configurations via command-line options
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide interactive prompts for configuration directory selection when not specified
- **FR-005**: System MUST prompt users for confirmation with clear warning when configuring an agent with an existing name, before overwriting the configuration

#### Multi-Agent Support
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain separate Docker build contexts for each configured agent
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure each agent deploys from its intended source code directory
- **FR-008**: System MUST support a global configuration that references individual agent configurations
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to list all configured agents and their current status
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate that each agent's source path exists and is accessible before deployment

#### Build Isolation
- **FR-011**: System MUST automatically create isolated deployment artifacts for each agent during launch operations
- **FR-012**: System MUST copy agent source code to isolated build directories to prevent accidental modifications during deployment
- **FR-013**: System MUST generate per-agent Docker files in isolated build directories during launch operations
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain build artifact organization that supports agent identification and cleanup

#### Error Handling and Recovery
- **FR-015**: System MUST catch all exceptions globally with proper error handling wrappers
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide clear, actionable error messages that help users understand what went wrong
- **FR-017**: System MUST report what resources (both AWS resources and local files) were successfully created before any failure occurred
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide cleanup instructions or automated cleanup for partial operations
- **FR-019**: System MUST log errors appropriately for debugging purposes without exposing sensitive information
- **FR-020**: System MUST prevent leaving the system in an invalid or inconsistent state after errors

#### User Experience
- **FR-021**: System MUST provide clear feedback about configuration file locations and organization
- **FR-022**: System MUST show progress indicators for operations expected to take more than 5 seconds
- **FR-023**: System MUST allow users to verify their configuration before deployment
- **FR-024**: System MUST provide helpful commands to troubleshoot common configuration issues
- **FR-025**: System MUST automatically clean up all configuration files and build artifacts immediately when an agent is destroyed or removed

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Agent Configuration**: Represents an individual agent's settings including name, entrypoint, source path, and deployment configuration
- **Configuration Directory**: Represents the file system organization for storing agent-specific configurations and build artifacts
- **Global Configuration**: Represents the master configuration that tracks all configured agents and their locations
- **Build Artifact**: Represents the isolated deployment files automatically created during launch, including copied source code and generated Docker files
- **Error Context**: Represents the state information needed for error recovery including both AWS resources and local files created during partial operations

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-06
- Q: What should happen when a user tries to configure an agent with a name that already exists? → A: Prompt user to confirm overwriting with clear warning
- Q: What should be the cleanup/retention policy for unused agent configurations and build artifacts? → A: Clean up immediately when agent is destroyed/removed
- Q: What types of resources should be tracked and reported during error recovery? → A: Both AWS resources and local files
- Q: What defines a "long-running operation" that requires progress indication? → A: Operations expected to take >5 seconds
- Q: When should the packaging workflow be mandatory versus optional? → A: Don't introduce new commands, integrate into existing workflow
