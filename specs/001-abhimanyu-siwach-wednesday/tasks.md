# Tasks: Multi-Agent Configuration Safeguards and Error Handling

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-abhimanyu-siwach-wednesday/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Task Details

### Enhanced CLI Task Descriptions
- **T028**: Add `agentcore configure list` subcommand that displays all configured agents with their current status (CONFIGURED, DEPLOYED, READY, ERROR), entrypoint paths, and last modified timestamps. Use Rich tables for formatted output.
- **T028a**: Implement interactive prompts using questionary to allow users to select custom output directories when `--output-directory` is not specified during `agentcore configure`. Include validation for directory write permissions and clear guidance text.
- **T028b**: Add `agentcore configure verify [--agent-name AGENT]` command that validates agent configuration completeness, source path accessibility, AWS credentials, and deployment readiness. Provide detailed validation report with actionable error messages.

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD requirement)
- Maintain 90% test coverage throughout implementation
- Each task should be atomic and completable in <2 hours
- Commit after each completed task
- Follow constitutional principles: three-layer architecture, idempotent operations, CLI-first interface
- All file paths are absolute and reference existing codebase structure
- Progress indicators required for operations >5 seconds
- User confirmation required for destructive operations
- Comprehensive error handling with resource tracking for both AWS and local resources

## Task Generation Rules
- Each contract operation → contract test task [P]
- Each entity in data-model → model creation task [P]
- Each quickstart scenario → integration test [P]
- Each user story → implementation task (sequential if same file)
- Different files = parallel execution allowed [P]
- Same file = sequential execution (no [P])
- Tests must be written first and must fail (TDD)
