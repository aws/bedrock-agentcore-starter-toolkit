# Implementation Plan: Enhanced Configuration Management with Backward Compatibility

**Branch**: `002-only-enhance-and` | **Date**: 2025-01-06 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-only-enhance-and/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Primary requirement: Enhance existing AgentCore Starter Toolkit configuration management with backward-compatible source path tracking and build artifact organization. The solution focuses on simplifying user experience while maintaining complete compatibility with existing `.bedrock_agentcore.yaml` configurations. Key enhancements include optional source path tracking, predictable build artifact organization, and improved status reporting - all designed to work seamlessly with the existing multi-agent configuration system.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.10-3.13 (currently working on 3.10)
**Primary Dependencies**: Typer (CLI framework), Rich (console output), Pydantic (data validation), boto3 (AWS SDK), PyYAML (configuration), Jinja2 (templates)
**Storage**: YAML configuration files (.bedrock_agentcore.yaml), local file system for build artifacts and source tracking
**Testing**: pytest with 90% coverage requirement, moto for AWS mocking, mypy for type checking, bandit for security
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform CLI (macOS, Linux, Windows) for local development and CI/CD environments
**Project Type**: Single CLI project with three-layer architecture (CLI → Operations → Services → Utilities)
**Performance Goals**: <5 seconds for configuration operations, progress indicators for operations >5 seconds, maintain existing performance
**Constraints**: Must maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing configurations, no new CLI commands, enhance existing workflow
**Scale/Scope**: Support existing multi-agent configurations with enhanced source tracking and build artifact organization

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**I. Three-Layer Architecture**: ✅ PASS - Feature enhances existing CLI → Operations → Services → Utilities layers without violations. Source tracking in Operations layer, artifact management in Utilities layer, CLI enhancements maintain existing patterns.

**II. Idempotent Operations**: ✅ PASS - All enhancements follow check-then-create pattern. Configuration extensions are backward-compatible, build artifact organization is idempotent, source path tracking uses existing configuration persistence patterns.

**III. Test-First Quality**: ✅ PASS - All new functionality will maintain 90% test coverage requirement. Backward compatibility, source tracking, and build artifact organization are fully testable with existing testing patterns.

**IV. CLI-First Interface**: ✅ PASS - No new commands introduced. All functionality integrated into existing `agentcore configure`, `agentcore launch`, and `agentcore status` commands following established patterns.

**V. AWS-Native Integration**: ✅ PASS - No changes to AWS integration patterns. Continues using boto3 sessions, maintains existing resource management approaches, no impact on AWS operations.

**VI. Security by Design**: ✅ PASS - No security implications. Source paths are local references, build artifacts are local files, no credential handling changes, maintains security boundaries.

**Initial Constitution Check**: PASS - No violations detected.

**Post-Design Constitution Check**: PASS - All design artifacts maintain constitutional compliance:
- Data model preserves three-layer architecture with optional schema extensions
- API contracts support idempotent operations with backward compatibility focus
- Quickstart scenarios validate CLI-first interface without new commands
- Build artifact organization maintains security by design with local file management
- Source path tracking integrates with existing AWS-native configuration patterns

**Structure Decision**: Single CLI project structure maintained. Enhancements distributed across existing three-layer architecture: CLI layer for enhanced user interaction, Operations layer for source path tracking and artifact organization logic, Utilities layer for configuration schema extensions and artifact management utilities. No changes to Services layer to maintain AWS integration stability.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract operation → contract test task [P]
- Each data model entity → schema enhancement task
- Each quickstart scenario → integration test task
- Implementation tasks following enhancement patterns (not greenfield)

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Enhancement order: Schema extensions → Operations enhancements → CLI improvements
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)
- Focus on backward compatibility validation tasks first

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md (smaller scope due to enhancement focus)

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
