This is a monorepo generated by the agentcore bootstrap CLI tool!

# Layout

There are three main directories created in this project: `src`, `mcp`, and `{insert_iac}`. In a monorepo setup all of the code--source, test, iac for deployment--is contained in one repository. Everything needed to
define code and deploy it into your AWS account is contained in this project.

The {insert_iac} directory models all of the Bedrock AgentCore and related resources. There are direct references between `{insert_iac}` and the runtime `src/`. For example, the {insert iac} code expects to find the
Dockerfile at a specific relative path.

# Deploying

If you want to skip the explanation of the `src/` directory and deploy straight away, here are the steps 

## src/

The src/ directory is where you will find the runtime code. {% if src_implementation_provided %} Since source code was provided in the .bedrock_agentcore.yaml, all of the code in the directory where `agentcore bootstrap`
was run was copied into `src`. No new runtime code is generated in the src/ directory. {% else %} 

Within the src/ directory:

Find the main entrypoint to the generated app, main.py. This file defines an agent using { insert the sdk_provider} and defines an entrypoint method with the Bedrock Agentcore SDK:

```
@app.entrypoint
def invoke(payload):
    # assume payload input is structured as { "prompt": "<user input>" } 
```

Next there is the `src/mcp_client` directory. Here you will find client.py. This file defines an MCP client from the chosen {insert sdk provider} library. That client points to the
gateway URL for the agentcore gateway that is modeled in the { insert iac name } directory. Behind that gateway is a custom MCP tool modeled as a lambda function (see below mcp section for more details).

{ if custom_authorizer_enabled } The authorizer for the gateway is the custom authorizer that was passed in .bedrock_agentcore.yaml. The `_get_access_token()` needs to be implemented
to successfully get JWT tokens from your custom authorizer. {else} The authorizer for the gateway is a cognito app client that is modeled in the { insert_iac name } directory. A call using
the client_credentials flow is defined in `_get_access_token()`

## mcp/

The mcp directory defines a simple python tool that meets the MCP specification called placeholder_tool. The specification for the tool's inputs are defined in the inline schema in the modeled
{ insert iac name } directory. When replacing the dummy implementation in `mcp/lambda/handler.py`, make sure to update the corresponding lambda target schema to reflect the changes before re-deploying.
The placeholder_tool implementation should help to demonstrate the tool_name and input payload conventions of a lambda behind the gateway. The gateway supports [flexbile target types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-add-target-api.html).
